# Online-Assignment-Automation

The usual notion of assignment submission is that of practical hand written submission to
the concerned evaluator. While it ensures successful submission but the method is quite
rigid in nature. Writing heaps of pages and submission by hand requires a great deal of time
and effort. There are times when the concerned teacher is also not available in the vicinity
or a student is unable to submit by hand. But, in todayâ€™s smart world, a person is always
available on the web and is ready to evaluate our jobs and tackle our queries on the go. To
keep up with the changing times of the modern world, assignment submission process also
needs to be up to date and efficient enough. A system needs to be devised which tackles
the aforesaid problem. The system needs to enable the users to view and submit assignment
questionnaire along with the solutions instantly through an internet connection. As a result
a whole lot of paperwork will be saved, the process will be time efficient and the storage
and handling of the assignments will be far simpler.


Online Assignment Automation Portal (OAAP) is a web based application which
can be used by students and teachers across various engineering institutions of a particular
branch, which can further be extended to various other educational institutions. It has been
developed so as to automate the ongoing assignment submission processes followed by the
students and teachers.
It is a more user friendly and time efficient approach. The users can register
themselves on the website to use the service. After successful registration and login the
users can use the services provided OAAP. The services include, the students downloading
required assignment questionnaire, uploading the solutions which can further be
downloaded by the teachers. Prior to which, the teachers can upload remarks which can be
viewed by the teachers.
The intention is to initially implement the OAAP partially along with the traditional
pen-paper approach and then slowly shift focus towards the complete automation, so that
the automation process can be carried out in a hassle-free manner.
